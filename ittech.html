					<h3><span>Mobile Application Development</span></h3>
					<p>
						<b>What does it do?</b> The Mobile Application Development has been around for years, with the latest innovation of wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch, Fitbit, or even the Google Fit, the technology of creating an application for the smartwatch is now more common than ever. The use of wearable devices is now becoming more popular, as it is not only fashionable and stylish, but also is convenient and multifunctional. I will focus mainly on Apple Watch for this spectrum. Apple made a smart choice of releasing the Apple Watch to the public, as it is like a compacted version of the iPhone. The mobile version of an application can now be transferred onto the smartwatch. All the applications can be downloaded onto your Apple Watch in only a matter of seconds, yet still functions like a normal iPhone. You can make or answer a phone call, receive notifications from your phone, and can also track your health, such as the number of steps you have walked, the number of calories you have consumed, your weight and height, etc. What seems to be impossible decades ago is now possible thanks to the development of mobile application. As for right now, developers can easily create an application using Xcode – a platform designed specifically to make an iOS application. On the aforementioned platform, developers can create an application for any of the Apple products (Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch) using the programming language C. In the next couple of years, I think that maybe the Mobile Application Development would expand to another kind of accessories, such as glasses. Apple Glasses is a perfect example for this, as this is a hybrid between the Mobile Application Development technology of the Apple Watch and the Augmented Reality technology of the Google Glass. This product is to be released the end of next year, which is the year of 2021. Another thing is that, with the given technology right now, after Apple Glasses there might be another piece of technology releasing soon. Assuming it is called “Apple Contact Lenses”, which is a less bulky version of the Apple Glass, but still has all of its technologies. The contact lenses will still be doing the job of the Apple Glasses but will be customized to your own glasses’ prescription. Changing the subject to mobile gaming, with the removal of Flash at the end of 2020, the Mobile App Development will be seeing a lot more developers who have moved from Flash to developing mobile game applications. This will create much more opportunities for developers to create their own unique applications. This would apply to all of the potential developers in the future too, for example, the “R-Map” project covers the Mobile Application Development area, as the intention of the project is to create an application designed to show the map of the Saigon South campus. We will be seeing a lot of more high-tech innovations in the future, given that the current technology is upgraded day-by-day. Many more mobile applications will be seen with a more specific use corresponding to each person’s usage.

						<b>What is the likely impact?</b> To start, the first thing that this development has an impact on is that people’s life would be more convenient due to the fact that people bring the phones with them all the time. If not necessary, they would simply leave the laptops at home and bring their phones with them. By developing an application which is a mobile version of a program from the laptop, the users will be more tempted to download the application as it is more convenient to use a mobile phone than a computer. Secondly, this development will open up many other kinds of improvement to the IT world. For example, GitHub – a platform specializes in building personal website – has their own application. However, the best that you could do is to create a pull request and look at the users’ repositories. Pushing and pulling files are not available on the application. With the expansion of Mobile Application Development, in the near future, there might be some chances that the two aforementioned actions would be available to mobile users. I think that, with the popularity of Mobile Application Development currently on the rise, there would not be many problems to encounter, as this can work in parallel with the computing system we have already used for decades. In addition to that, mobile phones are now more widely used than computers, if the developers can create a mobile application that can work cross-platform between computers and mobile phones, it would be beneficial for them.

						<b>How will this affect you?</b> As a person who does not like to sit in front of a computer for a long period of time myself, I think that this development will be better for me to just work on my mobile phone than on a computer. For the most part, I use my mobile phone to work for the sake of convenience, but sometimes, there would be some programs that are only available on the laptop. For instance, Visual Studio Code – a program used for writing codes – does not have a mobile application. This might have some disadvantages, as I do not want to carry my laptop all day, sometimes I even work on the go. Bringing a computer whenever I want to do anything would be a great hassle to deal with. Moving everything in the program into a compacted application on mobile phone would help me a lot. My parents and colleagues also use the mobile phones much more that they use their laptops, so this development would be beneficial for us.
