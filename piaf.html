					<h3><span>Project Ideas</span></h3>
					<p>
						<b>Overview:</b> For the project, I would like to create a mobile application called “R-Map”. This map is specifically made for the RMIT Saigon campus. The targets of the application are newbies and visitors as it can help them how to get to places in our school. Many cool features and activities will be included for the users (such as scanning the nearby constructions to know where you are standing, getting achievements for visiting a place, etc.). 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Motivation:</b> To my experience as a newbie, when I first came to school, I had difficulties getting to places as I did not know where all the rooms and facilities were. Also, I am an ambivert - which means that my personality features are mixed between introvert and extrovert - so asking random strangers for directions was a big no-no for me. I was desperate to have a map of the school. This is the reason why I wanted to create an application designed to show places in RMIT Saigon South campus, and with some of the features mentioned previously, I think this would be suitable for both introverts and extroverts to use.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Description:</b> In the application, there will be 3 main features: The Saigon South campus map itself, construction scan and achievements for exploring. Each feature will have their own usages which is beneficial to the users.
						<p>
							<b>The RMIT Saigon South campus map:</b> For this feature, the application will display the accurate mapping of the Saigon campus. This will be a bit similar to the existing Google Maps, but with much more details and only focus on the campus. There will be a search bar locating at the top of the map, so that the students can type in the room number in the format: “building number” . “floor number” . “room number” (for example, room 8.3.4 indicates that the room is in building 8, 3rd floor and is the 4th room of that floor) and easily find the room. There will also be a direction option for the users, pointing out how to get to the desired place. On top of that, all important places will be highlighted for easy access, including RMIT Connect, ILC, SOS Clinic, etc. (There will be a tab for highlighted places at the bottom of the map). Also, buildings will be put into different categories, for example, Nine restaurant, Sorrento, Lygon Cafe, and cafeteria area will be categorized as “Food”, and so on). If you tap on a room, the application will display its room number in the aforementioned format.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Construction scanning:</b> Construction scanning is a feature which uses the AR mapping technology to locate where the user is standing. It uses your phone’s camera to track your location by pointing the camera at a building nearby. From then on, the users can find out where they are with the provided information in the application. This feature represents some parts of the Pokémon Go’s PokéStop and PokéGym scanning mechanism, but instead of contributing to the system, this will provide information of the users’ current location. There will be an option of showing the location on the map at the bottom right of the map, thus helping the users to find exactly where they are.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Exploration achievement:</b> This feature is designed mostly for active people or people who likes to explore. Whenever the users visit a new room, the application will notify that they have unlocked a new achievement and granted a token. If this application were to be completed and used widely by RMIT, there will also be a rewarding system, which exchanges the tokens earned into gifts, such as RMIT notebook, RMIT mug, exclusive lanyard, and more. If the users want to save their progress as well as to exchange the tokens, they can sign up to the system using the RMIT account. This will mostly be close to the Pokémon Go system of spinning PokéStop to collect goods. This feature will help people to get their feet moving and go for a walk, which can also improve the physical health as well as to get to know the campus more.
						</p>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Tools and Technologies:</b> <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> - a platform for developing AR/VR applications – is needed for the “Exploration achievement” feature, and as for the other two features, <a href="https://www.geoapify.com/">Geoapify</a> is required for creating the RMIT Saigon South campus map for the project. If those platforms are unable to work on, the <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a> is also a great platform to build the application.
