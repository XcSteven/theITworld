					<h3><span>Project Ideas</span></h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						<b>Overview:</b> For the project, I would like to create a mobile application called “R-Map”. This map is specifically made for the RMIT Saigon campus. The targets of the application are newbies and visitors as it can help them how to get to places in our school. Many cool features and activities will be included for the users (such as scanning the nearby constructions to know where you are standing, getting achievements for visiting a place, etc.). 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Motivation:</b> To my experience as a newbie, when I first came to school, I had difficulties getting to places as I did not know where all the rooms and facilities were. Also, I am an ambivert - which means that my personality features are mixed between introvert and extrovert - so asking random strangers for directions was a big no-no for me. I was desperate to have a map of the school. This is the reason why I wanted to create an application designed to show places in RMIT Saigon South campus, and with some of the features mentioned previously, I think this would be suitable for both introverts and extroverts to use.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Description:</b> In the application, there will be 3 main features: The Saigon South campus map itself, construction scan and achievements for exploring. Each feature will have their own usages which is beneficial to the users.
						<p>
							<b>The RMIT Saigon South campus map:</b> For this feature, the application will display the accurate mapping of the Saigon campus. This will be a bit similar to the existing Google Maps, but with much more details and only focus on the campus. There will be a search bar locating at the top of the map, so that the students can type in the room number in the format: “building number” . “floor number” . “room number” (for example, room 8.3.4 indicates that the room is in building 8, 3rd floor and is the 4th room of that floor) and easily find the room. There will also be a direction option for the users, pointing out how to get to the desired place. On top of that, all important places will be highlighted for easy access, including RMIT Connect, ILC, SOS Clinic, etc. (There will be a tab for highlighted places at the bottom of the map). Also, buildings will be put into different categories, for example, Nine restaurant, Sorrento, Lygon Cafe, and cafeteria area will be categorized as “Food”, and so on). If you tap on a room, the application will display its room number in the aforementioned format.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Construction scanning:</b> Construction scanning is a feature which uses the AR mapping technology to locate where the user is standing. It uses your phone’s camera to track your location by pointing the camera at a building nearby. From then on, the users can find out where they are with the provided information in the application. This feature represents some parts of the Pokémon Go’s PokéStop and PokéGym scanning mechanism, but instead of contributing to the system, this will provide information of the users’ current location. There will be an option of showing the location on the map at the bottom right of the map, thus helping the users to find exactly where they are.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Exploration achievement:</b> This feature is designed mostly for active people or people who likes to explore. Whenever the users visit a new room, the application will notify that they have unlocked a new achievement and granted a token. If this application were to be completed and used widely by RMIT, there will also be a rewarding system, which exchanges the tokens earned into gifts, such as RMIT notebook, RMIT mug, exclusive lanyard, and more. If the users want to save their progress as well as to exchange the tokens, they can sign up to the system using the RMIT account. This will mostly be close to the Pokémon Go system of spinning PokéStop to collect goods. This feature will help people to get their feet moving and go for a walk, which can also improve the physical health as well as to get to know the campus more.
						</p>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Tools and Technologies:</b> <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> – a platform for developing AR/VR applications – is needed for the “Exploration achievement” feature, and as for the other two features, <a href="https://www.geoapify.com/">Geoapify</a> is required for creating the RMIT Saigon South campus map for the project. If those platforms are unable to work on, the <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a> is also a great platform to build the application.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Skills Required:</b> In order to build the application, knowing how to use the aforementioned platforms is crucial for completing the project. Moreover, some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Java would also be needed, considering the fact that these platforms use them as their language. The knowledge would be obtained both through learning at the university and further research. The research would mostly be through friends, teammates (if they have the adequate amount of knowledge) or the Internet. And if the project were to have some difficulties, our lecturer will be the one who helps us.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Outcome:</b> If the project is successful, when newbies come into RMIT, they only need to download the application on the phone and they would know exactly where their classrooms are without having to reach out to anyone, thus saving lots of time. This will also be for the sake of convenience, as well as helping introverts to avoid unwanted interactions. Additionally, with the “Exploration achievement”, students can squeeze in some exercises after class by going for a walk and exploring what the school has to offer, and by doing that, they can also earn some exclusive rewards given by RMIT.

					<h3><span>Feedback</span></h3>
					<p>
						<b>Nguyễn Thế Minh’s feedback:</b> This is an amazing idea and fit the program very much. It is executable and has many uses that could be helpful for many people in the campus. It is true that you can just remember the map in no time however, you could develop this app to have so much potential in the future. With the ability to connect places together, you could develop a place for the canteen to upload their daily menu, slots available in the library.  You could also check all the stuff in the convenient store, buy stuff and come later to get since you will be buying with your own ID account so you can save some time. This app has many applications that can be developed in the future which is a very nice idea to have. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Nguyễn Phương Nam’s feedback:</b> This idea amazes me very much because of its’ practicability. Anecdotally, I also get lost in our campus when I came here first time so I think newbies will be benefited most from this project.  In my opinion, R-map can be upgraded to an application of our school and map is just a part of it. For example, you can highlight college’s events for visitors or for students who only check their mail periodically. However, I wonder what skills are required for this project. Overall, this is an open application where the developers can add more function to improving campus life, but you should specialize the skills part.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Võ Trần Khánh Linh’s feedback:</b> Just like two other teammates, there would be a lot more functions that can be added based on your idea application. Some more functions we can consider, like adding the brief introduction about the usage of each room, showing the classes which will take place in that room (the schedule), booking a room to use and notifying about the availability of rooms in our campus (what time the room will available).
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Võ Khải Minh’s feedback:</b> I like your idea of this map because, in the begin of my first year, I had trouble finding classes and didn’t know how to locate locations, I tried to find a map, but the only that appeared is the map for RMIT university in Australia. This is an affective but straightforward idea, but also not too hard to do. with more functions, this could be an excellent app. I hope we can develop this into reality.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Response:</b> I agree with all of you that many more features could be added to the application. “R-Map” could be changed into “R-App” if necessary, by combining this with the existing Canvas application to create a multifunctional application for RMIT Saigon South campus students. We can also check for the availability of a product in the convenient store or a meal in the cafeteria. If possible, we can create another feature that is designed for the purpose of buying stuff in campus, which uses the students’ ID as a credit card and the application as a virtual wallet. The booking feature can also be added, not through Outlook Mail like what we have to do currently. As for the event feature, a filter can also be included, for students who want to check out the event of a specific club. For example, if someone wants to see which events are hosted by Music Club, they can press the “Filter” button and type in “Music Club”, the results should pop up. Apart from the aforementioned idea, I think that by merging STS - the timetable system – with our application, we can create a widget showing the timetable without having to download the calendar from the STS like what we are currently doing. All of your feedbacks were very helpful to me in order to improve my ideas on creating an application for the RMIT Saigon South campus students, as this has so much potential of executing successfully. If successful, we can expand it to the Hanoi campus, too.
